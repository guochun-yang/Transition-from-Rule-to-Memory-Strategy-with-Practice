This is the code of the computational model for manuscript "Cost-benefit Tradeoff Mediates the Rule- to Memory-based Transition during Practice" by Guochun Yang & Jiefeng Jiang.

Software requirement: Matlab

Installation guide: No installation needed.

Instruction to run the data:
  The basic model scripts are within folders Models_avatar and Models_avatar_decreasingcost. The former includes the key model while the latter is an alternative model to compare.
  To run the models with an example data (within the behdata folder), run the ModelAnalysis.mlx file.
  As indicated by the names, Model_comparison.xls is used to do the model comparison across alternative models; Model_plots.xls is used to do plot the model comparison and model prediction results; transition_switchcost_behavior is used to do the transition effect analysis.
  
Expected outputs are shown besides each cell of the mlx script.

Note: The models' orders (M0-M5) are not the same as the variable "imodel" used in the scripts due to some reorganization during drafting.
